# Product Vision: Bookshelf

## Mission

Help readers track what they've read and what they want to read next. One person, one bookshelf, zero social pressure.

## Personas

### Solo Reader
Reads 20-40 books per year. Loses track of what they've finished, what's in progress, and what's queued. Wants a simple, private reading log — not a social network.

### Book Club Organizer
Runs a monthly book club. Needs to maintain a shared reading list with a defined order. Cares about "what's next" more than "what's done."

## Anti-goals

- **Not social.** No followers, no feeds, no likes. This is a personal tool.
- **Not a marketplace.** No purchase links, no affiliate revenue, no price tracking.
- **Not a recommendation engine.** No "readers also liked" or AI-generated suggestions.
- **Not a review platform.** No star ratings, no written reviews, no public opinions.

## Won't have

- Reviews or ratings
- Purchase links or price comparisons
- AI-powered recommendations
- Social feeds, followers, or activity streams
- Reading challenges or gamification
- Integration with e-readers or library systems

### Must have
- Add, edit, and delete books with title, author, and reading status

- Reorder books within a reading list

- ISBN lookup for auto-filling book details

### Won't have (this version)

- Social features of any kind
- Mobile app (web only)
