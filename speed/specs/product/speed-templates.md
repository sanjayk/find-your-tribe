# Phase 1: Spec Templates

> Parent RFC: [Unified Intake & Defect Pipeline](../spec-templates-defects-integrations.md)

## Problem

Every SPEED spec starts from a blank page. Authors decide what sections to include, agents parse unpredictable formats. There are no canonical templates and no scaffolding command. This makes authoring slow and agent parsing unreliable.

## Users

### SPEED Operator
Writes specs to feed into the SPEED pipeline. Needs to know what sections each agent reads, what's required vs. optional, and where the file goes. Currently guesses at structure by looking at existing specs.

### New SPEED User
Setting up SPEED for the first time. Needs a fast path from "I have a feature idea" to "I have a spec SPEED can plan from." Currently blocked by the blank-page problem.

## User Stories

| ID | Story | Priority |
|----|-------|----------|
| S1 | As an operator, I want to scaffold a product spec so that I get the right sections pre-filled with guidance comments | Must |
| S2 | As an operator, I want to scaffold a tech spec so that I know what the Architect needs (data model, API surface, validation) | Must |
| S3 | As an operator, I want to scaffold a design spec so that I know what states and components to define | Must |
| S4 | As an operator, I want to scaffold a defect report so that I can describe a bug in 2 minutes with the right fields | Must |
| S5 | As an operator, I want the scaffold command to open my editor automatically so I can start writing immediately | Should |
| S6 | As a new user, I want the templates to include guidance comments explaining what goes in each section | Must |

## User Flows

### Scaffold a new feature spec

1. User runs `./speed/speed new prd my-feature`
2. SPEED creates `specs/product/my-feature.md` from the PRD template
3. SPEED replaces `{Feature Name}` with "my-feature" (human-readable)
4. SPEED opens the file in `$EDITOR` (if set)
5. User fills in sections, saves, closes editor
6. User repeats for `rfc` and `design` if needed

### Scaffold a defect report

1. User runs `./speed/speed new defect invite-failure`
2. SPEED creates `specs/defects/invite-failure.md` from the defect template
3. SPEED opens the file in `$EDITOR`
4. User fills in observed behavior, expected behavior, reproduction steps
5. User runs `./speed/speed defect specs/defects/invite-failure.md` to enter the defect pipeline

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `speed new prd <name>` creates `specs/product/<name>.md` with all PRD template sections
- [ ] `speed new rfc <name>` creates `specs/tech/<name>.md` with all RFC template sections
- [ ] `speed new design <name>` creates `specs/design/<name>.md` with all design template sections
- [ ] `speed new defect <name>` creates `specs/defects/<name>.md` with all defect template sections
- [ ] Each template includes `<!-- ... -->` guidance comments explaining what goes in each section
- [ ] Placeholder variables (`{Feature Name}`, `{name}`) are replaced with the user-provided name
- [ ] Files open in `$EDITOR` after creation (if `$EDITOR` is set)
- [ ] If the target file already exists, the command warns and does not overwrite
- [ ] `specs/defects/` directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Templates match the canonical formats defined in the parent RFC

## Scope

### In Scope
- Four templates: PRD, RFC, Design, Defect Report
- `speed new` CLI command with subcommands for each template type
- Template files stored in `speed/templates/`
- Placeholder replacement (`{Feature Name}`, `{name}`)
- `$EDITOR` integration
- Directory auto-creation for `specs/defects/`

### Out of Scope (and why)
- Agent-assisted drafting — that's Phase 2 (Intake Agent)
- Auto-numbering features (`F{n}`) — feature numbers are semantic, set by the author
- Template versioning — agents parse markdown flexibly, not needed yet
- Validation of filled-in templates — `speed validate` handles this separately

## Dependencies

None. This is Phase 1 — zero external dependencies, builds on existing SPEED CLI.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Templates become stale as agents evolve | Low | Templates are guidance, not contracts. Agents parse flexibly. Update templates when agent prompts change significantly. |
| Users skip guidance comments and submit hollow specs | Medium | The Architect's RFC review (Phase 2+) catches this. Templates can't force quality, only enable it. |
