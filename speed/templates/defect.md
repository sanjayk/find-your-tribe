# Defect: {Feature Name}

**Severity:** P0-critical | P1-high | P2-moderate | P3-low
**Related Feature:** {link to spec, e.g., specs/product/f4-tribes.md}
**Reproducibility:** always | intermittent (N/10) | once
**Last Known Working:** {version, date, or commit where this worked — or "never worked"}

## Observed Behavior
<!-- What actually happens? Be specific. Include error messages VERBATIM —
     copy-paste, don't paraphrase. "It shows an error" is useless.
     "TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined at TribeCard.tsx:42"
     is actionable. -->

## Expected Behavior
<!-- What should happen instead? Reference the spec if possible.
     e.g., "Per specs/product/f4-tribes.md §Invite Flow, the user should see
     a confirmation toast after sending an invite." -->

## Reproduction Steps
<!-- Numbered, sequential, from a known starting state.
     The single most important field. Without this, investigation is guesswork.
     Start from a specific state: "1. Log in as user with no tribes"
     not "1. Go to the app" -->
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Bug manifests

## Environment
<!-- Browser + version, OS, screen size, user account state, data conditions.
     "Chrome on Mac" is not enough. "Chrome 121 on macOS 14.3, 1440x900,
     user has 3 tribes and 12 pending invites" narrows the search. -->

## Error Output
<!-- Console logs, network responses, stack traces.
     Copy-paste the raw output. Don't summarize or redact unless it contains
     credentials. The Triage Agent needs exact error text to grep the codebase. -->

## Additional Context
<!-- Screenshots (annotated), screen recordings, related issues.
     If this is a regression, link to the PR or commit that likely introduced it.
     If it only happens with specific data shapes, describe the data. -->
