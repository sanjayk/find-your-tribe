  "title": "Profile page redesign with full-width editorial layout",
  "description": "Completely redesign the profile page at `src/frontend/src/app/profile/[username]/page.tsx` to match the approved prototype at `playground/concept-b-proof.html`.\n\nThis replaces the existing sidebar + main content layout with a full-width editorial flow following the PROVE → VOUCH → STATE trust hierarchy.\n\n**Reference the prototype HTML/CSS as the source of truth for layout and spacing.**\n\n## Page Layout (top to bottom)\n\nMax-width container: 1080px, centered, 24px horizontal padding.\n\n### 1. Hero Section (grid: 280px | 1fr, gap 48px)\n\n**Left column — Identity:**\n- Avatar: 88px circle with gradient background (accent-subtle to accent-muted), serif initial, accent color\n- Name: serif font, 40px, -0.01em letter-spacing\n- Handle: 14px ink-tertiary\n- Headline: 15px ink-secondary, 1.6 line-height\n- Availability badge: green dot + text in shipped-subtle bg with shipped color, 999px border-radius\n- Domain tags: using DomainTags component (from task 7)\n\n**Right column — Burn:**\n- BurnHeatmap component (from task 5)\n- AgentPanel component (from task 5), placed directly below heatmap with 12px gap\n\n### 2. Proof of Work Section\n- Section label: accent-line pattern (40px × 3px accent bar, then \"PROOF OF WORK\" in 12px uppercase)\n- Hero ProofCard (variant='hero') for the first in-progress project\n- 3-column grid of compact ProofCards for shipped projects, 16px gap\n- Each card gets data from the user's projects\n- Tribe attribution (\"via Tribe Name\") shown on cards where project has tribe_id\n\n### 3. Witnessed By Section\n- WitnessCredits component (from task 7)\n- Data: deduplicate collaborators across all projects, group by person showing which projects they contributed to\n\n### 4. Footer\n- ProfileFooter component (from task 7)\n- Tribes column: user's tribes with member counts\n- Links column: github, twitter, website from contact_links\n- Info column: timezone, primary role, joined date\n\n## GraphQL Query Updates\n\nUpdate `src/frontend/src/lib/graphql/queries/builders.ts` — the `GET_BUILDER` query needs to also fetch:\n- `agentTools`, `agentWorkflowStyle`, `humanAgentRatio` (already in UserType but may not be in the query)\n- Burn summary data (if the backend query is available, otherwise use mock data with a TODO)\n\nUpdate the page to use the new components. The page should be a **server component** that fetches data and passes props down.\n\n## Data Transformation\n\nThe page needs to transform GraphQL data into component props:\n- Projects → ProofCard props (separate in-progress hero from shipped compacts)\n- Collaborators → Witness props (deduplicate across projects, group by person)\n- User fields → AgentPanel props, DomainTags props, ProfileFooter props\n- Burn summary → BurnHeatmap props\n\nIf burn data is not yet available from the backend, create a `generateMockBurnData()` helper that produces realistic 52-week data (similar to the prototype's JS). Mark with TODO for replacement.\n\n## Important Notes\n- This is a FULL REWRITE of the page — the old sidebar layout is completely replaced\n- Do NOT modify the other components from tasks 5/6/7 — just import and use them\n- Follow the existing pattern for Apollo Client usage (see `discover/page.tsx` for reference)\n- The page should handle loading and error states gracefully\n- All styling uses Tailwind classes mapping to design tokens in globals.css\n- NO icons for information architecture — typography and layout only\n- No builder score anywhere — it was removed from the design",
  "acceptance_criteria": "- `src/frontend/src/app/profile/[username]/page.tsx` completely rewritten with full-width editorial layout\n- Hero section: 2-column grid with identity left, heatmap + agent panel right\n- Proof of Work section: 1 hero card + 3-column compact grid\n- Witnessed By section: film credits from WitnessCredits component\n- Footer: 3-column ProfileFooter component\n- Uses BurnHeatmap, AgentPanel, ProofCard, BurnReceipt, WitnessCredits, DomainTags, ProfileFooter components\n- Handles loading and error states\n- No sidebar layout — full-width editorial flow\n- No builder score displayed anywhere\n- No icons used for information architecture\n- Section labels use accent-line pattern\n- `cd src/frontend && npx eslint .` passes\n- `cd src/frontend && npx tsc --noEmit` passes\n- Page renders without runtime errors",
