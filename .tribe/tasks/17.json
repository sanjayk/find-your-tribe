  "title": "Create Alembic migration to drop endorsements table",
  "description": "Generate an Alembic migration that drops the `endorsements` table from the database. The migration should:\n1. Use `op.drop_table('endorsements')` in the upgrade function\n2. Optionally include a downgrade that recreates the table (or raise NotImplementedError if irreversible)\n3. Be named clearly (e.g., '20260214_drop_endorsements_table')\nRun `alembic upgrade head` to verify the migration executes successfully.",
  "acceptance_criteria": "- New migration file exists in `src/backend/migrations/versions/`\n- Migration drops the `endorsements` table in upgrade()\n- `alembic upgrade head` executes successfully\n- `endorsements` table no longer exists in the database\n- Backend starts successfully after migration",
