  "description": "Create realistic build activity seed data for all 10 seeded users across their projects.\n\nCreate `src/backend/app/seed/build_activities.py` with `seed_build_activities(user_ids: dict, project_ids: dict)` function.\n\nThe function receives mappings from the other seed functions:\n- `user_ids`: username \u2192 ULID\n- `project_ids`: project title \u2192 ULID\n\n**Data requirements:**\n\n1. Generate 52 weeks of daily activity data (365 days back from today)\n2. Each user should have a realistic activity pattern:\n   - **mayachen** (most active): 247+ days active, 1.2M+ total tokens, heavy Claude Code + Cursor usage across Tribe Finder, AI Resume Builder, GraphQL Playground Pro. Spike patterns around project ship dates.\n   - **sarahkim**: 200+ days, heavy on ML Pipeline Framework and DataLens. Mostly Anthropic source.\n   - **tomnakamura**: 180+ days, DevSync is his big project. Mix of sources.\n   - **priyasharma**: 160+ days, go-queue and MicroMon. Mostly manual + Anthropic.\n   - **marcusjohnson**: 120+ days, InfraBlocks focused.\n   - **jamesokafor**: 90+ days, Design System Kit. Lighter activity.\n   - **davidmorales**: 80+ days, Open Source CRM and Growth Analytics Dashboard. New builder pattern.\n   - **elenavolkov**: 150+ days, contributor on DataLens and Growth Analytics Dashboard.\n   - **alexrivera**: 60+ days, sparse/sporadic pattern.\n   - **aishapatel**: 30+ days, very new, just getting started.\n\n3. Each BuildActivity row needs: user_id, project_id (nullable for unattributed sessions), activity_date, tokens_burned (realistic range: 500-80000 per day), source (anthropic/openai/google/manual).\n\n4. Use realistic patterns:\n   - Weekday activity higher than weekends\n   - Spike periods around project milestones\n   - Some days with no activity (gaps)\n   - Multiple sources per user but each user has a dominant source\n\n5. Bulk insert using `session.execute(insert(BuildActivity), rows)` for performance.\n\n6. Add `seed_build_activities` to `src/backend/app/seed/__init__.py` exports and integrate into the seed runner so it runs after projects are seeded.\n\n**Important**: Check how the existing seed runner works (look at `src/backend/app/seed/__init__.py` and any CLI/script that calls the seed functions) to ensure build_activities seeds are called in the right order with the right parameters.",
  "acceptance_criteria": "- `src/backend/app/seed/build_activities.py` exists with seed_build_activities function\n- Generates data for all 10 users with varying activity levels\n- Activity spans 52 weeks with realistic patterns (weekday bias, spikes, gaps)\n- Uses correct BuildActivitySource enum values (lowercase)\n- Bulk inserts for performance\n- Exported from seed/__init__.py\n- Integrated into seed runner (called after projects seed)\n- `cd src/backend && ruff check .` passes\n- Seeding completes without errors when run against the database",
